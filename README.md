# Machine-Learning-for-Insurance-Predicting-Claimants

Predicting claims is essential to the decision making process of many insurance companies. This is because claims can affect the capital of the insurer, and the capacity of the company to underwrite future businesses (van der Veer 2019). Traditional methods of claim predictions are not only time consuming, but also very costly. 
There are a ton of machine learning predictive algorithms already working in fields of text-to-speech, fraud detection, self-driving cars, etc. Therefore, machine learning can be used in predicting claims.
The following will be taken into  consideration when analysing the problem to be solved;
* The predictive task recommended for this project. 
* The learning procedures we will use in this task, and the reason for choosing it. 
* Examples of possibly informative features that could benefit the predictive investigation. 
* The evaluation process for system performance before deployment.
